# CS2063 Introduction to Mobile ApplicationDevelopment
## Project Overview
In groups of two (preferably) or three, you will be required to design and implement an Android application from the ground up.  This project will be worth 40% of thefinal grade and will be made up of deliverables throughout the semester.  
Requirements
The requirements for the projectare relatively open to allow flexibility in terms of creation.  However, certain conditions must be met:
* It must be a native Android application built with the Android SDK
* The functionality must be implemented as a native Android application and not using other means such as a responsive web, hybrid, or a non-mobile application
* The application must adhere to best practices for Android development.  For example:
  * Program design
  * Coding style
  * Resource consumption considerations
  * User interface design
* The application must incorporate substantial functionality inherent to mobile devicessuch as: 
  * Usage of device sensors, location support
  * Layouts that adapt to different form factors and orientations
  * Touch and gesture input
* The application must exhibit non-trivial functionality which serves a useful or entertaining purpose
  * This could be filling a gap in existing offerings or improve upon an existing application
* The application must have a professional polished interface 
* The application should support a wide range of devices

If you are unsure whether your idea meets these guidelines, please feel free to discuss with me during office hours.
