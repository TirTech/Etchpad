## How To
This page details the device-to-device capabilities with Etchpad. Note: Location is required to use this feature. In order to connect to another device, that device must be nearby (within bluetooth range).

### Terms
Remote Canvas: The canvas on the other device.

Remote Client/User: The other user connected to your device

### Starting a Connection
To begin sharing a canvas with a remote user open the menu and navigate to Connect > Host Canvas. If you wish to join a user already hosting, choose Join Canvas instead. There is no feature difference between the host and remote, however one user must host and the other joins (you cannot have two hosts/joins).

Once a device is found, each user must verify that the presented code matches. If either user rejects, the connection is closed. Once devices are verified users may choose a name to display over their cursor (these do not have to be unique). When both users are done the devices will synchronize their current drawings. Upon completing the dialog will close and you can draw!

### Changes in the experience
When drawing remotely, most features will work as expected with remote drawing. However, saving and loading will only save your drawing, **not** the remote user's. If you wish to save both, you must disconnect first. This limitation includes Export as JPG

### Disconnecting
To disconnect, choose Disconnect in the Connect section of the menu. You will be prompted if you would like to keep the remote user's drawing.
